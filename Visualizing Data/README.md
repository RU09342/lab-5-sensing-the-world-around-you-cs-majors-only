# LCD Display

## LCD Discussion
The temperature was read from a voltage regulator and displayed on the LCD screen of the FR6989. The temperature reading's accuracy varies 
depending on how far the temperature being read deviates from the 30 degrees celcius range. As the temperature leaves the range, it varies
by a few degrees depending on how far the temperature deviates from the 30's range, but the reading is still relatively accurate 
regardless. The goal of this part of the lab however, is not to measure the accuracy of the temperature. The lab focuses on being able
to present data on the LCD display of the MSP430 board, which was successfully done. The result is seen in the attached video labeled "Lab5LCD"
in the repository. Additionally, the code used to implement this functionality is uploaded to this repository.

## LCD Code
The code should be compiled in CSS and run in the MSP430. The MSP430 should then be placed in the appropriate part of the temperature
sensor circuit.
